I hope that data science can help me to understand how to model children’s mathematical thinking and classroom interaction. Here is my linkedin\nI watched the video “How to Get Your Materials Online With R” Here is the video\n\n\n\n\nHere is the summary: Educators create a lot of files for teaching- slides, exercises, solutions, assignments, data, figures- that all ultimately need to be shared with other people. Having a link for sharing your teaching materials can save you time and pain, but it is hard to get started if you’ve never shared your resources online before.
