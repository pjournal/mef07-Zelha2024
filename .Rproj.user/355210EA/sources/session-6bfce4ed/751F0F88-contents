SHINY

Here is my Shiny Project:

Here you can select 3 countries, and three levels of performance in 2022 PISA math test (level 1 (low), Level 3, (medium) and Level 6 (high) performing students Percentage.) You can also choose whether it is **Government (g)** or **Private(p)** schools and within those schools how they perform: for example, % of government schools that perform on low level will be ***glevel1a***
